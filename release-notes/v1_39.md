## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the September 1.39 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the September milestone release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[September iteration plan](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80591)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22September+2019%22+is%3Aclosed)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the [VS Code repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues) on GitHub.

## Debugging

### Improved UI for column (aka inline) breakpoints

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/31612

Please note that this feature requires specific support by an underlying runtime or debugger, and we expect only a few debug extensions like **Node Debug** and the **Debugger for Chrome** to opt into this feature in the future. For this release, only our example debugger [Mock Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreweinand.mock-debug) "mocks" support this.

### Inline debug actions available in CALL STACK view

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79189

### Improved CALL STACK view behavior

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80004

Please subsume all thread/session/focus related improvements here

### Improved link detection in debug console

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/27713

### PreLaunchTask can now refer to default build

TODO@isidorn, TODO@alexr00 https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/32239

With the introduction of a new variable `${defaultBuildTask}` it is now possible to have a generic `preLaunchTask` that always refers to the default build task:
```json
{
	"name": "Hello World",
	"type": "node",
	"request": "launch",
	"preLaunchTask": "${defaultBuildTask}"
}
```

### Disable showing errors resulting from the "preLaunchTask"

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/68084

## Contributions to extensions

### Java 13 support 

[Java 13](http://jdk.java.net/13/) is out and VS Code supports Java 13 through latest [Java Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java). For developers use Java 12 with preview features, you will need to migrate to 13 to keep working with them.

### Deprecation mark for deprecated Java class, method or field

The Java language server adopts the [Deprecated Diagnostics Tag](/updates/v1_37#_diagnosticstagdeprecated) which renders the code in problem with a strike-through line. 

## Extension authoring

### New debug API for configuring output destination for multi-process debugging

TODO@isidorn https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/62419

## Debug Adapter Protocol

### Cancellation support

A new `cancel` request has been added to the Debug Adapter Protocol that can be used to give a hint to the debug adapter that the frontend client is no longer interested in the result produced for a specific request issued earlier.

This request has a hint characteristic: a debug adapter can only be expected to make a 'best effort' in honouring this request but there are no guarantees. A frontend client may only call this request if the capability `supportsCancelRequest` is defined and has the value of `true`.

The request that got canceled still needs to send a response back. This can either be a normal result or an error response.
Returning partial results from a cancelled request is possible but please note that a frontend client has no generic way for detecting that a response is partial or not.

In the September release VS Code supports cancellation for the `stacktrace`, `scopes` and `variables` requests (used in the **CALL STACK** and **VARIABLES** views) and the `completions` requests (used in the Debug Console).

Please note that as of September only the [Mock Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andreweinand.mock-debug) extension implements cancellation.

### Finding possible breakpoints in a source range

The new `breakpointLocations` request can be used by a DAP client to find all possible breakpoint locations in a given source range.
This can be used in the UI in order to improve the discoverability of "inline" (aka "column") breakpoints.

A client may only call the `breakpointLocations` request if the `supportsBreakpointLocationsRequest` capability is defined and has the value of `true`.

## Notable fixes

* [79196](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/79196): debug console shows REPL results and console.log output in wrong order
* [80003](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/80003): Regular breakpoints don't have a title tooltip
